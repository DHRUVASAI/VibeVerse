**Required Sections:**
1. Hero Section with badges (technologies, license, status)

3. Overview (what it does, key features, what makes it special)
4. Tech Stack (tables for Frontend, Backend, APIs, DevOps)
5. Folder Structure (tree format with descriptions)
6. Installation (prerequisites, step-by-step setup, env variables)
7. Features & Architecture (core features, architecture diagram, data flow, optimizations)
